## 🧐How to build？


- Mainly using  [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/) -Project documentation with Markdown.


> MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.


- The default theme of *mkdocs* is ugly，so I choose to use [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).


> Material is a theme for MkDocs, an excellent static site generator geared towards project documentation. It is built using Google's Material Design guidelines.


just a simple command `mkdocs gh-deploy`, then you can deploy it in Github pages. Now this project is deployed not only [GitHub Pages](https://roseauhan.github.io/cookbook/)，but also [readthedoc](https://roseau-cookbook.readthedocs.io)，but the readthedoc version can only using the default theme.


- ⚑ I will write a more concrete article to help your guys to learn it later.
